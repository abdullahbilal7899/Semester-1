<p class="copy"><br>
<span style="color:#e67e22;">Message from the Board Chair and the President:</span>
Welcome to Cambridge Memorial Hospital's (CMH) website. We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with information about our hospital. Our vision is to provide the residents of Cambridge and North Dumfries with exceptional, high quality and safe patient care by our exceptional staff, physicians and volunteers.
This year, we are focusing on two organizational priorities: delivering high quality, sustainable care for our patients and building a new hospital that will serve you and your family for the next 50 years. We are very pleased to be in the construction phase of our project. All six levels of the new patient care wing are now visible and is gradually becoming enclosed as each day passes!
This year is an important one for the hospital and our community, as we plan for our eventual occupation of the new patient care wing. We expect to first move in by spring of 2017. At that time our staff, physicians and volunteers will have a few months to "commission" the building (i.e., install clinical and IT equipment, test medical lines, etc.) so that we can begin treating patients. Yes, we will be moving the Emergency Department entrance once again, but this time it will remain in the same place for the next 50 years!
At CMH, we are very proud to demonstrate our accountabilities to our community. We believe that a transparent hospital is one you can trust. You can view the patient safety public reporting indicators we report to the public, such as the surgical safety checklist. You can see our commitment to patient safety by reading the latest Quality Improvement Plan. All of our accountabilities are grouped under four easy to navigate tabs called Quality in Patient Care, Financials, Wait Times and Policies.
If you want to learn more about us and our accomplishments over the past year, please read our Report to our Community, which will come out in the fall of 2017 or sign up to read communit-E-cast newsletter. We welcome input from our community and would like to what you have to say about CMH. If you have a story to share or a concern you want answered, please send your message using the contact information below.
Regards,
Joseph Kane, Chair, Board of Directors
Patrick Gaskin,  President and CEO

<center><h2 class="text-center">Our Achievements</h2></center>


<p class="copy">Since 2000, the Top Hospitals awards have celebrated achievement in healthcare quality and improvement. Every NHS hospital trust in the UK is entered automatically for the awards, which are judged using nationally available datasets. The excellence in dementia care award is based on a variety of patient outcomes, compliance against best practice standards, and on-site visits to the shortlisted acute trusts.

Jason Harries, CHKS managing director, said: "We are delighted that Cambridge University Hospitals is one of our 40Top Hospitals for 2013. These awards recognise outstanding performance in 22 areas which we believe are critical to delivering good patient care."
<center><br><br><img src="images/cuh-award (1).jpg" class="img-responsive" /></center>
<br><p class="copy">The award coincides with the Trust signing up to the Dementia Action Alliance, a UK body of more than 480 organisations committed to transforming the quality of life of people living with dementia.

On its action plan, Cambridge University Hospitals has pledged to:

improve the hospital as a dementia-friendly physical environment
invest in staff training and development to improve awareness of dementia among clinical and non-clinical staff across the organisation
develop a dementia buddy programme for volunteers. Since February 2013, every volunteer has been required to undergo dementia awareness training and more specialised training will be provided for dementia “buddies”
embed the dementia assessment tool across the Trust, which ensures all patients aged over 75 admitted as an emergency are screened for cognitive impairment
implement a system for identifying patients with cognitive impairment
better engage with families and carers
