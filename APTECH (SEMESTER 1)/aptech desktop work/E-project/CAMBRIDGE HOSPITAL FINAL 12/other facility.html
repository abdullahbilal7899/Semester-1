<h1>DIALYSIS FACILITY</h1>

<img src="images/bare miyan.jpg" />
<p class="copy">
The kidneys are a pair of organs, each about the size of a fist, located on either side of your spine. They’re responsible for purifying your blood by removing waste and excess fluid from your body. When the kidneys don’t work properly, dialysis is used to perform the function of the kidneys.

Dialysis is a treatment that filters and purifies the blood using a machine. This helps keep your body in balance when the kidneys can’t do their job. Dialysis has been used since the 1940s to treat people with kidney problems.<br><br>
Why Is Dialysis Used?<br><br>
purpose
Properly functioning kidneys prevent extra water, waste, and other impurities from accumulating in your body. They also help control blood pressure and regulate the levels of chemicals in the blood, such as sodium, or salt, and potassium. They even activate a form of vitamin D that improves the absorption of calcium.<br>

When your kidneys can't perform these functions due to disease or injury, dialysis can help keep the body running as normally as possible. Without dialysis, salts and other waste products will accumulate in the blood and poison the body. However, dialysis isn’t a cure for kidney disease or other problems affecting the kidneys. Different treatments may be needed to address those concerns.
<h2>New technology helps boost home dialysis</h2>
<img src="images/dialysis.jpg" /><br>
<b><p class="copy">Home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis could bring huge medical and psychosocial benefits for patients living with kidney failure.<br></b><br><br>

Home dialysis frees patients from the need to attend hospital for four hours three days a week. “Instead of  dialysis controlling their lives, they can fit dialysis around their schedules,” says Dr Sunita Nair, Nephrologist at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust.<br>

“With home haemodialysis patients can dialyse longer hours, even overnight, more closely mimicking the physiological function of kidneys. This provides better blood pressure and phosphate control, along with a lower pill burden and dietary restrictions.”<br>

Home haemodialysis has improved survival rates among patients with kidney failure. “The five-year survival rate for people on extended nocturnal home dialysis is 85 per cent - comparable to patients with a kidney transplant from a deceased donor,” says Dr Nair.<br>

Home dialysis enables patients to return to work – often hard to fit round hospital dialysis. Costs to society and the NHS are also reduced.<br>

In 2014*, of the 48 per cent of kidney failure patients on dialysis, 6 per cent are on peritoneal dialysis (PD), which is normally done at home. Of those on haemodialysis, 2 per cent are home dialysing - far short of the 2002 NICE guidelines that aim for 10-15 per cent of dialysis patients to home dialyse, but numbers are rising.<br><br><br>

 
<b>New technology</b><br><br>
 
Improvements in medical technology and increased patient education are making home dialysis easier, says Dr Shashidhar Cherukuri, consultant nephrologist at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust.<br>

“The newer home haemodialysis machines are the size of a large computer printer and operate with a cartridge loading and a push button. They are portable, with in-built water purification, so need only be connected to the household tap,” he says.<br>

Patients require less training to use them compared to older models, and Dr Cherukuri says: “There have been concerns that older patients may be more reluctant to use them but in my experience most can and want to.”<br>

For PD patients, bio-compatible dialysing fluids are reducing the problems of using the peritoneal membrane as a dialysis filter.<br><br>

 
<b>Keep informed<br></b><br>
 
Home haemodialysis is not suitable for people who are extremely frail, have active psychiatric problems, uncontrolled seizures, unstable cardiac conditions or extreme skin lesions. It is contraindicated in homeless patients, with lack of patient personal and home hygiene or active drug dependence. Additionally, PD is also contraindicated in people with complex abdominal surgery.<br>

Patient concerns about problems while home dialysing are addressed by ensuring good training and telephone links with their renal team and dialysis equipment suppliers.<br>

But both doctors expect home dialysis to grow. Dr Cherukuri says: “Greater awareness of the benefits among medical teams and patients combined with new technology mean home dialysis is set to become more common.”<br>
