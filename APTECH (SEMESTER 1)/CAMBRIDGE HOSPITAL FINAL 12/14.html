<h1 style="color:#FF5C0F"> Parents ‘blown away by the care’ at the Rosie’s neonatal unit</h1>
<p>
The mother of a little girl who was born critically ill last year at the Rosie says she can’t thank the hospital enough for caring for Skye and saving her life.</p>
<p>
Bec France and Scott Kelly found themselves in every parent's worst nightmare last year when their daughter Skye was immediately placed on the resuscitation table as soon as she was born.</p>
<p>

She had a life-threatening condition where her blood was being forced away from the lungs due to high blood pressure.
<br>
<br>

Known as Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN), the condition decreases the body's supply of oxygen and she spent 22 days in the hospital having specialist treatment to help her breathe.
<br>
<br>

Bec, from Chesterton, said: "We felt we were walking through a terrible dream. I went from feeling numb and in shock to feeling very scared. We were preparing ourselves for awful news. But we were determined not to lose hope for Skye.
<br>
<br>

"The first few days were bad for Scott and I. We never expected her to be ill. I had a really healthy pregnancy and she was full term. She was a big healthy baby. It really turned everything upside down."
<br>
<br>

Bec said she could not thank the hospital enough for caring for Skye and saving her life.
<br>
<br>

"The hospital were incredible," she said. "We're New Zealanders and have been here eight years. We realised we were lucky to be still living in Cambridge, it has one of the best neonatal intensive-care units (NICU) in the country. People come from all over the region to be at the Rosie. I just think the specialist there are at the forefront of their field.
<br>
<br>

"We were blown away by the care, not just medically, but how they looked after us. We had a really good team for the first four days. When Skye was really critical they were not sure if she would survive or not."
<br>
<br>

Since leaving the Rosie, Skye - who is now 18-months-old - has gone from strength to strength and the family now want to give back to the charity which they valued so much.
<br>
<br>

While Skye was being treated, Bec, 34, and Scott, 35, were able to stay right by her side at The Sick Children's Trust-run Chestnut House, within the hospital.
<br>
<br>

"Through the haze, we were thrown a lifeline and were given accommodation at The Sick Children's Trust's Chestnut House," said Bec. "Staying at Chestnut House meant we were just minutes from Skye's side at any time of day. I cannot express how important this was.
<br>
<br>

"Skye was critically sick and things were changing minute by minute, and we didn't want to leave her. We spent all our time with her – holding her hand, singing, sitting quietly and reading the messages of support that came flooding in.
<br>
<br>

"It was quite a daunting world the NICU, all the machines and the beeping. But having all the other parents at Chestnut House was a big support for us.
<br>
<br>

"I think what they do is so important. The charity really does rely on voluntary support. A lot of parents are often an hour away from hospital. It's heart breaking. I don't know how you would leave a child. The Sick Children's Trust allows you to stay close, I think it saves children's lives."
<br>
<br>

The Sick Children's Trust's Chestnut House opened at The Rosie Hospital in 2012, and in the last year it has supported 200 families.
<br>
<br>

Bec France and Scott Kelly, of Chesterton, are hosting a 'lindy hop' dance fundraiser 'Give Baby Give' this weekend to raise money for the charity.
<br>
<br>

Factfile:
<br>
<br>

- It is estimated that persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn affects around 2 in every 1,000 newborn babies.
<br>
<br>

- It occurs when a newborn's circulation system doesn't adapt to breathing outside the womb.
<br>
<br>

- PPHN is a rare but life-threatening condition that appears most often in full-term or post-term babies who have had a difficult birth or conditions such as infection or birth asphyxia.
<br>
<br>

- In treatment for PPHN, the main goal is to increase oxygen flow to the baby's organs to prevent serious health problems
<br>
<br>

- Treatments for it include oxygen, assisted ventilation and nitric oxide</p>
