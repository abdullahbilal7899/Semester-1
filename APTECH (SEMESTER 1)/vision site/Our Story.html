<p class="copy1">

Gwendolyn Rogers has created a storybook restaurant in a cottage that took two and a half years for her to design & remodel.  When you walk through the French doors, the sparkling chandeliers, antiqued mirrors, French inspired furniture, beautiful seasonal decorations and the rich aroma of the French chocolate cakes baking in the oven immediately greets you. Enjoy French pressed coffee with a slice of homemade cake or pie. Enjoy a cup of warm sipping chocolate topped with fresh whipped cream and a warm cookie right out of the oven. She offers an incredible lunch of ‘The Best Quiche You Will Ever Have’, homemade soups, salades, sandwiches, even a true French Croque Monsieur.  The evenings offer charcuterie boards with imported meats, cheeses and olives served on elegant marble tiers. Behind the kitchen window, master bakers gently sieve non-bromated flours from Vermont, aluminum-free baking powders & sugars and large pots of French & Belgian Chocolate melting on the stove. Once the oven dings, everything at the<b> Yame Bakery Shop </b>has come together to create a truly sweet and savory experience. Choose from our list of the best French wines & champagnes to accompany any of our lunches, cakes, cookies, pies & desserts. Gwendolyn’s Yame Bake Shop has become the destination of Indianapolis for celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and all the special occasions life offers.
