<h1 style="color:#FF5C0F"> Addenbrooke's 250th Anniversary Open Day a huge success</h1>
<p>Addenbrooke’s Open Day was a great success with more than 5000 people flocking to the Hills Road site to learn more about the work of their local hospital.</p>
<p>The Open Day on Sunday 20 March was the second in a series of events this year celebrating 250 years since Addenbrooke’s was founded.</p>
<p>Visitors were spoilt for choice with over 60 talks, activities, and displays at the Open Day, which shared the last day of the University of Cambridge Science Festival on the campus. Some of the most popular events included the Teddy Bear Hospital, the operating theatre tour and the da Vinci robot.</p>
<p>Jane Ramsey, CUH Chair, said:</p>
<p>“The Open Day was great opportunity to showcase all the brilliant work that goes on and all the hard work of the staff and the volunteers.</p>
<p>“It was fantastic that so many people came to enjoy all the activities and learn more about the work of the hospital, and not only about the treatments we provide at the hospital, but also about the future of research, education and developments which will ultimately help patient care.</p>
<p>“We feel very optimistic about the future and we're looking forward to the next 250 years.”</p>
<p>Rikin Trevidi, a consultant neurosurgeon and associate director of post-graduate medical education, said: </p>
<p>"Two hundred and fifty years is an important landmark for us to look back to how it was all started and how we're now cutting edge and pioneering while not forgetting our grass roots and the caring needs of the local population.</p>
<p>"The care that's given and produced by the regional centre is outstanding. Care is at the heart of what we do and there's a sense of pride to be involved with the organisation.</p>
<p>Mr Trevidi gave the lecture Putting Neurosurgery Under the 3D Microscope and ran workshops at the Open Day.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to share their experiences of Addenbrooke’s by visiting our dedicated website – www.cuh.org.uk/250openday</p>
<p>Visitors to the Open Day were able to:

<p>Addenbrooke’s Hospital opened its doors on Trumpington Street in 1766 thanks to Dr John Addenbrooke who left £4,500 in his legacy (when he died in 1719), ‘to hire and fit up, purchase or erect a small, physical hospital in the town of Cambridge for poor people.’</p>
<p>Originally housing just 20 beds in four wards it treated 263 patients.  In 1766 - Ann Perry was the first Matron; the first 3 physicians – Plumptre, Glynn and Collignon; and the first 3 surgeons – Hayles, Hopkins and Thackeray Lefebvre; and there was a Resident Apothecary (unknown)</p>
<p>Today’s hospital, including the Rosie Hospital, has 1,000 beds, an income of £719m, over 8,000 staff, 57 wards and treats nearly a million people a year.</p>
